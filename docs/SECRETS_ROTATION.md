# Secrets & Key Rotation Procedures (#527)

This document outlines recommended procedures and tooling for rotating GitHub secrets, Stellar keys, and service role credentials safely without downtime.

Acceptance Criteria
- Rotation steps are documented
- Secrets can be rotated without downtime
- Compromised credential handling is defined

1. Goals

- Minimize service downtime during rotation.
- Ensure there is an auditable, repeatable process for rotating credentials.
- Provide a clear incident response for compromised credentials.

2. Scope

- GitHub repository secrets (Actions, Environments)
- Stellar keypairs used for contracts and service accounts
- Cloud/service role credentials (CI/CD runners, hosted services)

3. High-level Rotation Steps

- Prepare: identify secret owners, usage locations, and dependent services. Record current versions in a secure audit log.
- Staged rollout: create a new credential alongside the existing one and deploy config that accepts either key (dual-authorization) where possible.
- Switch: update consumers to use the new credential and verify functionality.
- Revoke: remove old credential once verification and cool-down windows complete.

4. GitHub Secrets

- Use GitHub Environments for environment-specific secrets and restrict access via required reviewers.
- To rotate:
  1. Add new secret value under a temporary key name (e.g., `MY_SERVICE_KEY_v2`).
  2. Update workflows or services to read the new key name (support both during rollout).
  3. After verification, rename or remove the old key and set the canonical key name to the new value.

5. Stellar Keys

- Use a key management system (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store Stellar seed phrases.
- To rotate service keys:
  1. Generate new keypair and store seed securely.
  2. Update contract owners or service account associations to include the new public key where necessary.
  3. Update consumers incrementally to use new signing keys (dual-signing where possible).
  4. Revoke old seed access.

6. Service Role Credentials

- Where supported, use short-lived credentials (STS) and rotating tokens via a secrets manager.
- Document the rotation schedule and automate via CI jobs that update secrets and trigger a verification pipeline.

7. Compromised Credential Handling

- Immediate actions:
  - Revoke the compromised credential immediately.
  - Audit recent logs and rotate any related keys.
  - Create incident ticket and notify stakeholders.
- Post-incident:
  - Rotate all related credentials.
  - Review and improve access controls.

8. Automation suggestions

- Use scripts or CI jobs to perform the staged rollout and verification steps. Example: `scripts/rotate-secret.sh` which will create new secret, update environment, trigger smoke tests, and finalize rotation.

9. References
- See `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` and repository CI config for current secret usage patterns.
